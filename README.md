# E-Store Sales Operations

## Project Overview

This project consists of a **pre-existing backend API** and a **newly developed frontend** that I built based on an existing Figma UI design.  
I translated the design into a working frontend using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and connected it to the backend via API.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies and Logic Used

- **Frontend:**
  - UI design (not by me) from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/GhvclsuMFaTHMthjjmpClY/E-Store?node-id=5489-395&t=tM4HU2F5dLl6BMNl-1)
  - HTML & CSS for layout and styling
  - Vanilla JavaScript with modular structure
  - `XMLHttpRequest` for all API requests
- **Logic Implemented:**
  - Full CRUD operations (products, stock, sales)
  - Search and filtering
  - Dynamic UI updates
  - Stock quantity validation
  - Error handling and user feedback
- **API Testing:** via Postman (`tools/STORE-API.postman_collection.json`)
